      <h2>My Cat Nyx</h2>
      <p>
        I found Nyx, my little stray cat, in my backyard 2 years ago. In December 2022, a small stray cat was crying loudly in the backyard of my apartment. It was snowing heavily, and she looked cold, so I opened the door and let her in. Then, I decided to adopt her. Unlike other naughty cats, Nyx never bites, causes trouble or knocks things off the table. I love my little cat dearly, and I think she loves living with me just as much. Nyx has made my life as a student abroad so much more great. Nyx comes over and nudges my hand to comfort me whenever I feel down or anxious. I had never owned a cat before, and neither have any experience, but Nyx always seems forgiving of my mistakes. Now, with her companionship, I feel a special kind of happiness every day.

      <h2> Game Recommendation</h2>
      <p>As a Games & Interactive Media student, I always keep an eye on recent game releases, and over the past six months, quite a few titles have truly amazed me. One game that stood out is Black Myth: Wukong. This is a Souls-like action game uniquely combines elements of ancient Chinese mythology, specifically Journey to the West, creating a fresh and captivating experience. The stunning visuals and impressive action and skill designs really pull players in. Itâ€™s remarkable that Game Science, the developer, is the first time making AAA games. Their hard work has clearly paid off, reflected in both player acclaim and impressive sales numbers.
